# Lab 4 — Partition, mirror, fail, recover

## Windows
 
Added one 1 GB dynamically allocated disk (`lab04-win.vdi`) to the existing SATA controller of the Windows 11 guest while it was powered off. In the guest (PowerShell as administrator), `Get-Disk` showed it as disk 1 with partition style `RAW`.
 
```powershell
Initialize-Disk -Number 1 -PartitionStyle GPT
New-Partition -DiskNumber 1 -UseMaximumSize -AssignDriveLetter | Format-Volume -FileSystem NTFS -NewFileSystemLabel LAB04
```

```
 
The volume is 1007.93 MB rather than 1 GB because GPT and NTFS keep part of the disk for their own structures.
 
**MBR or GPT:** GPT. The guest boots Windows 11 with UEFI, and its system disk (disk 0) is already GPT, so a GPT data disk keeps the machine consistent; GPT also stores a backup copy of the partition table at the end of the disk and protects it with a checksum, so a damaged table can be recovered, and it has no 2 TiB or four-primary-partition limit like MBR.
 
## Linux — layout before and after
 
Added three 1 GB dynamically allocated disks (`lab04-d1`, `lab04-d2`, `lab04-d3`) to the Ubuntu guest's SATA controller while it was powered off. They appear as `sdb`, `sdc`, `sdd`. The system disk is `sda`.

```
 
`md0` now runs on `sdb1` and `sdd1`. `sdc1` still carries its RAID superblock (so `lsblk` still labels it `linux_raid_member`), but it is no longer part of `md0`.
 
## What I did
 
All commands run in the Ubuntu guest from `~/lab04-storage`; each evidence file was saved at the moment that state existed.
 
**1. Look before touching, save the empty layout**
 
```bash
mkdir -p ~/lab04-storage/evidence && cd ~/lab04-storage
{ echo '$ lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINTS'; lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINTS; } > evidence/lsblk-before.txt
```
 
**2. One RAID partition on each disk**
 
```bash
for d in sdb sdc sdd; do sudo parted -s /dev/$d mklabel gpt mkpart primary 1MiB 100% set 1 raid on; done
```
 
**3. Create the mirror from two partitions, wait for `[2/2] [UU]`, save the healthy state**
 
```bash
sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
cat /proc/mdstat
{ echo '$ cat /proc/mdstat'; cat /proc/mdstat; echo; echo '$ sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0'; sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0; } > evidence/array-healthy.txt
```
 
**4. File system, mount, proof files, checksum before the failure**
 
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L mirror /dev/md0
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mirror
sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/mirror
sudo chown $USER: /mnt/mirror
echo "Lab 4 proof file — Dinmukhamed Muratbek — $(date)" > /mnt/mirror/proof.txt
head -c 20M /dev/urandom > /mnt/mirror/random.bin
cd /mnt/mirror && { echo '$ sha256sum proof.txt random.bin'; sha256sum proof.txt random.bin; } > ~/lab04-storage/evidence/checksum-before.txt; cd ~/lab04-storage
```
 
**5. Fail one disk on purpose (with `mdadm --fail`, not by detaching the disk), save the degraded state, prove the data survived**
 
```bash
sudo mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sdc1
sudo mdadm /dev/md0 --remove /dev/sdc1
{ echo '$ cat /proc/mdstat'; cat /proc/mdstat; echo; echo '$ sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0'; sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0; } > evidence/array-degraded.txt
cd /mnt/mirror && { echo '$ sha256sum proof.txt random.bin'; sha256sum proof.txt random.bin; } > ~/lab04-storage/evidence/checksum-after-failure.txt; cd ~/lab04-storage
diff <(tail -n +2 evidence/checksum-before.txt) <(tail -n +2 evidence/checksum-after-failure.txt) && echo "checksums match"
```
 
Output of the last line: `checksums match`.
 
**6. Add the third disk, rebuild, save the rebuilt state, keep the array after reboot**
 
```bash
sudo mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdd1
cat /proc/mdstat
{ echo '$ cat /proc/mdstat'; cat /proc/mdstat; echo; echo '$ sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0'; sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0; } > evidence/array-rebuilt.txt
sudo mdadm --detail --scan | sudo tee -a /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
sudo update-initramfs -u
```
 
The rebuild of a 1 GB array with a write-intent bitmap finished before the next `cat /proc/mdstat`, so no `recovery = …%` line was caught.
 
**7. Evidence to the host** (run on the host, not in the guest)
 
```bash
scp -P 2222 -r dima@127.0.0.1:lab04-storage/evidence labs/lab04-storage/
```
 
## Three states
 
| State | What /proc/mdstat showed | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Healthy | `[2/2] [UU]` — sdb1 + sdc1, `State : clean` | [evidence/array-healthy.txt](evidence/array-healthy.txt) |
| Degraded | `[2/1] [U_]` — sdb1 only, `State : clean, degraded` | [evidence/array-degraded.txt](evidence/array-degraded.txt) |
| Rebuilt | `[2/2] [UU]` — sdd1 replaced sdc1, `State : clean` | [evidence/array-rebuilt.txt](evidence/array-rebuilt.txt) |
 
Checksums before and after the failure: **match**.
 
| File | SHA-256 before ([checksum-before.txt](evidence/checksum-before.txt)) | SHA-256 after ([checksum-after-failure.txt](evidence/checksum-after-failure.txt)) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| proof.txt | `14025afe…68d5fb` | `14025afe…68d5fb` |
| random.bin | `65b122fe…b11104` | `65b122fe…b11104` |
 
## RAID is not a backup
 
Your colleague deleted the wrong file from the mirror an hour ago. Does RAID 1 help? Why?
 
No, RAID 1 does not help. The mirror copies every write to both disks at the same moment, so the deletion happened on `sdb1` and `sdd1` together, and there is no older copy anywhere in the array to go back to. RAID protects against a disk failing, as in this lab, while only a backup (a separate copy from an earlier point in time, stored apart from the array) can bring back a file that a person deleted or overwrote.
 
## What did not work the first time
 
1. **The checksums did not match.** On the first attempt I ran the step that creates `proof.txt` and `random.bin` again after taking `checksum-before.txt`. Each run writes a new date and new random bytes, so the "before" and "after" sums came from different files, and the evidence showed a mismatch even though no data was lost. Fix: I tore the array down and repeated the whole experiment, creating the files exactly once.
2. **`lsblk-before.txt` was taken too late.** It already showed the partitions and `md0`, not three empty disks. Fix: before the second attempt I stopped the array (`mdadm --stop`), erased the RAID superblocks (`mdadm --zero-superblock`) and partition tables (`wipefs -a`), removed the old array from `/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf`, rebooted, and only then saved `lsblk-before.txt`.
3. **Erasing the partition table did not erase the data.** On the second attempt `mkfs.ext4` warned that `/dev/md0` already contained an ext4 file system labelled `mirror` from the first attempt. `wipefs` only removed the signatures at the start of the disks; the new partitions and array started at the same offsets, so the old file system was still there. I answered `y` to overwrite it.
4. **Pasting a multi-line loop failed.** The terminal inserted `^[[200~` (bracketed paste) before the `for` loop, so bash saw a syntax error and the next line ran with an empty `$d`, as `parted /dev/`. It failed safely. Fix: `bind 'set enable-bracketed-paste off'` and pasting the loop as a single line.
5. **The Windows VM would not start** (`VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` for `lab04-win.vdi`). The disk file had been moved to the host's trash. Fix: restored it from `~/.local/share/Trash/files/` to the VM folder.
