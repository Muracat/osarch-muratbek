# Lab 2 — A Windows guest, and a network between them

Pair: Dinmukhamed / Amira
Machine: OMEN by HP Laptop Arch Linux 16GB 16CPU, guests Ubuntu Server + Windows 11 Enterprise eval
Date: <23.10.2026>

## What I did
1. Downloaded Windows 11 Enterprise evaluation. Licence: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise
2. Created lab02-windows: 2 vCPU, 4 GB, 64 GB thin, UEFI + Secure Boot, vTPM.
3. Network mode: NAT, both guests. Why: I used NAT Network because both guests must see each other and internet.
4. Ping Ubuntu → Windows timed out because Windows Defender Firewall blocks incoming echo requests by default. Fixed with: `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow ping in (ICMPv4)" -Protocol ICMPv4 -IcmpType 8 -Direction Inbound -Action Allow`
5. Overcommitment: set 10 GB + 10 GB on a 16 GB host.

## Network diagram

     [VirtualBox NAT · NatNetwork · 10.0.2.0/24]
          /                        \

```

## Result
| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Host RAM in use |5GiB |14GiB |
| Available |9GiB |554MiB |
| Committed / Swap used |3.2GiB |839MiB |
| What I noticed | — |Host system freezes when VMs have memory overcommited.  |

## What did not work the first time
At the first time freeze was so strong I couldn't take a screenshot. 

## Evidence
- [evidence/ipconfig-windows.txt](evidence/ipconfig-windows.txt) — Windows address
- [evidence/ip-addr-linux.txt](evidence/ip-addr-linux.txt) — Ubuntu address
- [evidence/ping-both-ways.txt](evidence/ping-both-ways.txt) — both directions and the internet
- [evidence/host-memory-before.png](evidence/host-memory-before.png) — host memory, guests off
- [evidence/host-memory-after.png](evidence/host-memory-after.png) — host memory, both guests overcommitted
